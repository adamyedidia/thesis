Note that the program flow of the compiled machine on the left is easier to understand; the program flow of the compiled machine on the right depends on what function is at the top of the stack. However, note also that if the set of states that represents ``Code 7,'' ``States 7,'' is very large, the stack-on-tape method is much more parsimonious than the inlining method in this case. On the left, ``States 7'' appears four times, but on the right it only appears once. }}{12}}
